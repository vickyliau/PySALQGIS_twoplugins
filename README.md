PySALQGIS_twoplugins

This is a part of results, building two PySAL plugins in QGIS for GPH 4/598 Geocomputation, taught by Dr. Sergio Rey. 

P.S.1 the code works for the old version of QGIS and python 2.5, so it does not work for the current QGIS version
P.S.2 the whole implementation is a group project, so the uploaded files only include my own work.
